## 🚀 Olist E-commerce Data Analysis Project

The Olist e-commerce dataset is a collection of data provided by Olist, a Brazilian online marketplace that allows small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products. The dataset includes information about customer orders, product details, payment methods, reviews, and seller data.

You can see the SQL diagram of the dataset below:

I organized my Olist data analysis project into four main categories: 
- 📦 **Order Analysis**: Wrote SQL queries to examine order data and identify patterns.
- 👤 **Customer Analysis**: Analyzed customer demographics and behavior with SQL queries.
- 🛍️ **Seller Analysis**: Conducted SQL-based analysis of seller performance and sales data.
- 💳 **Payment Analysis**: Used SQL queries to evaluate payment methods and installment details.

I wrote separate SQL queries for each analysis, then transferred the query results to an Excel file and visualized them in Excel.
